This is a personal project of mine in which I'm trying to make a greek theme slot. 

This project is a fully functional slot game with a dynamic UI built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game includes multiple symbols, paylines, and payouts, providing an interactive experience with both regular and bonus game modes. Players can select bets, trigger bonus rounds, and experience winnings through animated pop-ups.

## Key Features:
- **Paylines:** Payouts across 40 paylines.
- **Bonus Mode:** Buyable bonus mode with 8 free spins, featuring sticky Wild symbols.
- **Animation:** Animations for spins, bonus triggers, bonus tease, winnings.
- **Sound Effects:** Background music, sound when payment occurs, special sounds on bonus.
- **Dynamic Bet System:** Players can adjust their bet size, dynamically affecting payout calculations, through a user friendly UI.

## Technical Components:
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for spins, payouts, symbol selection, and handling bonus modes.
- **HTML/CSS:** Structured layout including animations, pop-ups, and button actions.
- **Audio Integration:** Audio effects based on game states.
- **Animations:** Custom CSS animations.
